            <h3>Stem cell therapy</h3>
            <p>Developed a pancreas from umbilical mesenchymal stem cells. Research indicates that there are stem cellwhich are found in the umbilical cord and equally within our bodies. The stem cells are able to differentiate into specific organs, tissues or cells if the correct genetic sequence that codes for the function of the respective organ is injected. For instance the liver is responsible for deamination and detoxification. The project was able to reach the regionals level at the Kenya Science and Engineering Fair</p>
